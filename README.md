* **Large Jet Engines:** Hefty 2.5m engines - turbofans and turbojets for big aircraft.
* **Advanced Propeller Engines:** Super-efficient low speed propfans and turboprops.
* **Lift Fans:** Designed specifically for efficient VTOL and available in many sizes, these engines can run on LiquidFuel and air, or be * driven electrically for flight in oxygenless atmospheres.
